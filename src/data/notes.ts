Hi, I’m Sweedal 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience building clean, scalable, and user-focused web applications. I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering and product — where small details, performance, and usability really matter.

I primarily work with React, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling, and I care a lot about writing code that’s readable, maintainable, and easy to reason about. I’m especially interested in building interfaces that *feel* good to use — fast, intuitive, and thoughtful.

Outside of work, I enjoy refining my skills, exploring product design patterns, and constantly improving how I approach problem-solving as an engineer.

Software Engineer — Frontend  
4+ years of professional experience

I’ve worked as a frontend engineer at product-based companies, contributing to real-world applications used by customers at scale.

My work involved:
• Building and scaling React-based interfaces for customer-facing products
• Translating Figma designs into accessible, high-quality UI with strong attention to detail
• Taking ownership of features from concept to production-ready implementation
• Working with REST APIs and managing complex client-side state
• Continuously improving performance, UX consistency, and code quality
• Collaborating closely with designers, backend engineers, and product managers in Agile teams


I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from understanding requirements to implementation, refinement, and polish.

More detailed role and company information is available in my resume.
